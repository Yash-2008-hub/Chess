# 2-Player Chess Game

This is a simple, interactive chess game for two players built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns making moves on a traditional 8x8 chessboard. The game doesn't have any AI, so it's designed for two players to play locally on the same device.

## Features

- Traditional 8x8 chessboard layout.
- Player turns (white and black).
- Ability to move pieces according to the official chess rules.
- Piece highlighting for legal moves.
- A turn indicator to show whose turn it is (White or Black).

## How to Play
- The game starts with Player 1 (White pieces) making the first move.
- Click on a piece to select it, and then click on a valid square to move it.
-The turn will automatically switch after each move.
-Continue playing until the game ends (either by checkmate, stalemate, or draw).

##Special Features
- **Legal Move Highlighting:** Valid moves for the selected piece are highlighted in green.
- **Piece Movement:** Pieces move according to standard chess rules (rooks move vertically/horizontally, bishops move diagonally, etc.).
- **Turn Indicator:** The game displays whose turn it is, showing "White's Turn" or "Black's Turn".
## Technologies Used
